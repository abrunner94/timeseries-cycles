# Timeseries Cycle Predictions
The goal of this repo/Jupyter notebook is to show how regression models can be used to predict the next "cycle" within a timeseries dataset.
The data being used has been generated randomly, but you are free to modify the `generate_synthetic_data` function or incorporate your own data set.
